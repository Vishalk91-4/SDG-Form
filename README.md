# SDG FORM

<h3>From this form, several features and functionalities have been developed:</h3>

<br>1. React Hook Form: The form has been built using React Hook Form, which is a popular library for managing form state and validation in React applications. It provides an intuitive API for handling form inputs and submitting data. </br>

<br>2. Firebase Integration: The form has been integrated with Firebase, a platform that offers various cloud-based services. This integration allows the form data to be stored and managed in real-time within a Firebase database, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. </br>

<br>3. Glassmorphism Design: The user interface of the form has been enhanced using the glassmorphism design trend. This design style creates a modern and visually appealing interface by applying translucent and blurred glass-like elements, giving a sense of depth and elegance to the form. </br>
